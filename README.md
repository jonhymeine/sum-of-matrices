# Sum of Matrices

### Goal
This assembly program sums two square matrices of a user-specified size (between 2 and 10) chosen via the terminal. The resulting matrix is then saved and printed. To traverse the matrix, users can choose between two methods: line-wise (option 0) and column-wise (option 1).

### How to run?
To run the program, you need to execute [`main.asm`](./main.asm) file in [RARS](https://github.com/TheThirdOne/rars).
